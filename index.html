            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.</p>
            <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

            <p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).</p>
            <p>There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.</p>
            <p>For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.</p>
            <p>To print a string in Python 3, just write:</p>
            <code>print("This line will be printed.")</code>

          <header>Variables and Types</header>
          <article>
            <p>Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object..</p>
            <p>This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables..</p>
            <h1 >Integer and Float</h1
            <p>Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals).</p>
            <p>To print a string in Python 3, just write:</p>
            
            <code>myint = 7
  print(myint)
            myfloat = 7.0
  print(myfloat)
  myfloat =
  print(myfloat) float(7)</code>

          <article>
            <p>Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.</p>
       
            <code>mylist = []
  mylist.append(1)
  mylist.append(2)
  mylist.append(3)
  print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
  print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
  print(mylist[2]) # prints 3
  
  # prints out 1,2,3
  for x in mylist:
      print(x)int("This line will be printed.")</code>

            <p>As you can see, the first thing you learned was printing a simple sentence. This sentence was stored by Python as a string. However, instead of immediately printing strings out, we will explore the various things you can do to them. You can also use single quotes to assign a string. However, you will face problems if the value to be assigned itself contains single quotes. For example to assign the string in these bracket(single quotes are ' ') you need to use double quotes only like this.</p>
       
            <code>astring = "Hello world!"
  print("single quotes are ' '")
  
  print(len(astring))</code>

           <section class="main-section" id="String Formatting">
          <header>String Formatting</header>
          <article>
            <p>Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".</p>
       
            <code># This prints out "Hello, John!"
  name = "John"
  print("Hello, %s!" % name)</code>
            
            </article>
            </section>

          <header>Basic String Operations</header>
          <article>
            <p>This prints a slice of the string, starting at index 3, and ending at index 6. But why 6 and not 7? Again, most programming languages do this - it makes doing math inside those brackets easier.
  
  If you just have one number in the brackets, it will give you the single character at that index. If you leave out the first number but keep the colon, it will give you a slice from the start to the number you left in. If you leave out the second number, it will give you a slice from the first number to the end.</p>
       
            <code>astring = "Hello world!"
  print(astring[3:7:2])</code>

          <header>Condition</header>
          <article>
            <p>Python uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated. For example:</p>
       
            <code>x = 2
  print(x == 2) # prints out True
  print(x == 3) # prints out False
  print(x < 3) # prints out True</code>

                <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
          <header>Loops</header>
          <article>
            <p>There are two types of loops in Python, for and while.
  
  The "for" loop
  For loops iterate over a given sequence. Here is an example:</p>
       
            <code>primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
  for prime in primes:
      print(prime)</code>

                <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
          <header>Functions</header>
          <article>
            <p>Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".
  
  Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name. For example:</p>
       
            <code>def my_function():
      print("Hello From My Function!")</code>
